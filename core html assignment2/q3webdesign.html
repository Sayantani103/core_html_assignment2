    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>web design refers to the process of creating the visual aesthetics and layout of a website. It involves the use of graphic design principles, color schemes, typography, and user interface considerations to enhance the overall look and feel of a website. Web designers focus on creating an engaging and user-friendly experience, ensuring that the design effectively communicates the content and purpose of the site. While web design often overlaps with web development, it primarily emphasizes the visual and interactive aspects of a website rather than the underlying technical functionality.</p>

    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p>web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves a combination of skills and technologies to design, build, and deploy functional and visually appealing content on the internet. Web development encompasses various components, including front-end development (dealing with the user interface and user experience), back-end development (managing server-side logic and databases), and full-stack development (involving both front-end and back-end aspects). Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries are commonly used in web development.</p>
